# Twitter_Search_Sentiment_Analysis

This was my Jupyter Notebook I submitted for a datathon I participated in. The problem statement was to web-scrape Twitter for NFT related hashtags and then to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets. Each NFT related hashtag was given a label, either Positive or Negative, and was also given a score. The score ranged from the lowest possible score of 0.00 to the highest score of 1.00. The tweets ranged from dates March 4, 2022 to March 23, 2022. I also web scraped tweets and performed sentiment analysis on those tweets based on a Twitter username "coinbase" and the a Twitter Search criteria of "nfts".

I also created some data visualizations of the Sentiment Analysis using Power BI and Matplotlib.
